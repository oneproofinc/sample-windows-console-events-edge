## üîß Requirements

- Windows OS (x64)
- .NET 6.0 or later
- ONEPROOF Edge device
- Native DLLs: `edge_windows.dll` (contact ONEPROOF for access)

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers)

1. **Clone this repository**

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Add the required DLLs**:
   - Place `edge_windows.dll` and `edge_windows.dll` in the output directory
   - Default location: `bin\Debug\net6.0` or `bin\Release\net6.0`

4. **Run the sample app**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Program.cs` ‚Äì Main entry point demonstrating basic usage
- `UsbEventService.cs` ‚Äì Core service class with P/Invoke bindings and USB monitoring logic

## üíª Integration Guide

### 1. Initialize the Service

```csharp
var usbService = new UsbEventService();
```

### 2. Start Monitoring

```csharp
usbService.StartMonitoring(
    json: "{ \"org.iso.18013.5.1\": { \"issuing_country\": true } }",
    onEvent: (eventData) => Console.WriteLine(eventData),
    verify: true,
    timeoutSeconds: 30
);
```

### 3. Handle Events

The service supports the following event types:

| Code | Event Name | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | DEVICE CONNECTED | ONEPROOF Edge device connected |
| 2 | DEVICE DISCONNECTED | ONEPROOF Edge device disconnected |
| 3 | QRCODE SCANNED | QR code scanned from device |
| 4 | DEVICE HKDF KEY | Device key received |
| 5 | BLE CONNECTED | BLE connection established |
| 6 | BLE DISCONNECTED | BLE connection terminated |
| 7 | BLE SENDING | Data being sent via BLE |
| 8 | BLE RECEIVING | Data being received via BLE |
| 9 | DATA RECEIVED | Data successfully received |
| 10 | VERIFYING DATA | Data verification in progress |
| 11 | ERROR | Error occurred during operation |

## üîå Native Integration

The sample uses the following native methods from `edge_windows.dll`:

```csharp
[DllImport("edge_windows.dll")] 
public static extern void register_event_callback(UsbEventCallback callback);

[DllImport("edge_windows.dll")] 
public static extern void start_usb_monitoring(byte[] dataPtr, UIntPtr dataLen, bool verify);

[DllImport("edge_windows.dll")] 
public static extern void stop_usb_monitoring();

[DllImport("edge_windows.dll")] 
public static extern bool is_monitoring_active();
```

## üìù Data Request Format

The JSON configuration specifies which data elements to request from the ONEPROOF Edge device:

```json
{
  "org.iso.18013.5.1": {
    "family_name": false,
    "given_name": false,
    "portrait": false,
    "issuing_country": true,
    "birth_date": false,
    "issuing_authority": true
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Ensure `edge_windows.dll` is compiled for x64 architecture
- The ONEPROOF Edge device must be connected via USB
- Proper error handling should be implemented in production code
- Contact ONEPROOF for licensing and support
